# Guitar Hero
This application produces sound similar to a string being plucked by generating white noise on a ring buffer and applying a wave function to the signal that fades with time simulating friction.

## To use:
javac GuitarHero.java
java GuitarHero

the keyboard alphabet is as follows:
private static String keyboard = "q2we4r5ty7u8i9op-[=zxdcfvgbnjmk,.;/' ";
use any one of those keys to produce a sound.
